This is a blog website in which you can add various blogs by adding pieces of text with a specific title in the "compose" section. It has been mainly developed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, EJS, NodeJS and ExpressJS.

There are a few basic libraries which need to be imported from the Node Package Manager(npm) like express, body-parser, ejs, lodash and node_modules.

The commands for extracting these libraries are as follows:
 
npm install express
npm install body-parser
npm install ejs
npm install lodash

The local server can be monitored using a special NPM library called Nodemon. You first need to extract it using the Git command npm install nodemon and then in order to run the local server using it, you can type the following command:
nodemon app.js
Nodemon library regularly tracks all the changes being rendered in the web application and consistently keeps updating the local server.
